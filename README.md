# Memoru

Show how much time has passed since or is remaining to a specified date and time

This app will show how many days/hours/minutes/seconds have passed since a certain date and time (or how much time until a certain date/time in the future).  The time is superimposed on the picture of your choice.  You can change the text size, color, and position as well as the position of the picture.  

The word memoru means "remember" in Esperanto (it's not just "memory" misspelled). 

The launcher icon was modified by my son by using the GIMP's smudge tool on the carefully drawn icon I created, but I liked the way it looked so I decided to keep it.  

This app has no ads or in-app purchases and collects no data.  

The source code is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later.  

The app icon was created with Stable Diffusion.
